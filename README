Graphical User Interfaces, The UNIX Way
=======================================

Pipeglade is a helper program that displays graphical user interfaces
for other programs. It renders the GUI definition found in a
GtkBuilder file (created using the Glade Interface Designer), and
communicates with the main program solely via pipes or fifos.

INSTALLATION

  make

should build a usable binary.

  make PREFIX=/some/dir/

installs the pipeglade binary in /some/dir/bin/ and its manual page in
/some/dir/man/man1/


TESTS AND FIRST STEPS

  ./pipegladetest.sh

runs pipeglade's tests (which require some human assistance).  The
GtkBuilder file of the test GUI, pipeglade.ui, is also used in the
demonstation script

  ./echo.sh,

which redirects the messages initiated by user activity on the GUI
back into a text area of the same GUI.

There are two other example GtkBuilder files.  To see how they look
like, call

  ./pipeglade -u simple_dialog.ui

or

  ./pipeglade -u simple_open.ui.
