Graphical User Interfaces, The UNIX Way
=======================================

Pipeglade is a helper program that displays graphical user interfaces
for other programs. It renders the GUI definition found in a
GtkBuilder file (created using the Glade Interface Designer), and
communicates with the main program solely via pipes or fifos.

INSTALLATION
============

  make

should build a usable binary.

  make PREFIX=/some/dir/ install

installs the pipeglade binary in /some/dir/bin/ and its manual page in
/some/dir/man/man1/.  Default PREFIX is /usr/local/.

To get rid of the installation, call

  make uninstall

or

  make PREFIX=/some/dir/ uninstall

respectively.


TESTS AND FIRST STEPS
=====================

  ./pipegladetest.sh

runs pipeglade's tests (which require some human assistance).  The
GtkBuilder file for the test GUI, pipeglade.ui, is also used in the
demonstration script

  ./echo.sh,

which redirects the messages initiated by user activity on the GUI
back into a text area of the same GUI.  Another example,

  ./clock.sh,

uses the GtkBuilder file clock.ui and displays an analog clock.

There are three other example GtkBuilder files.  To see how they look
like, call

  ./pipeglade -u simple_dialog.ui

or

  ./pipeglade -u simple_open.ui.

The third one, bad_window.ui, is for testing, and is intentionally
broken.
